# 100 Days of Machine Learning Code

100 Days of Machine Learning Code. Full instructions about the challenge [here](https://github.com/george-studenko/100_Days_of_ML_Code/blob/master/100_Days_of_ML_Code_Instructions.MD)

Here you can find a very useful [Machine Learning Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/)

## Day 0 : Sep 29 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have joined and attended [AI Saturdays](https://nurture.ai/ai-saturdays) in Barcelona today, I completed a couple of chapters on the Computer Vision Nanodegree I'm working on right now. I've been working on creating masks to do some image edition with CV2 (OpenCV). Learned about color spaces (RBG, HSI and HSL) and worked on a simple image classifier, creating a basic ML pipeline to load images, preprocess images and predict and image label.  

**Thoughts** : Getting to work and know people who is interested in AI, ML and DL is great to share knowledge and encourage each other, a great way to learn. Computer vision is a daunting part of AI, but with the right material, teachers and projects I think I will manage to pull it over, got time until the end of December 2018 to get it done.

## Day 1 : Sep 30 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I've started to work on the Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs Google's fast-paced, practical introduction to machine learning today.

**Thoughts** : This is a good beginners course, useful to refresh some concepts and get to practice tensorflow.

## Day 2 : Oct 1, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Finished the lessons: Image Representation and Classification, Convolutional Filters and Edge Detection from the computer Vision Nanodegree, only 3 lessons to go to start with the first project: Facial Keypoint Detection.

**Thoughts** : Edge detection can be quite useful to detect images, Hough transformations are also quite useful to detect lines that correspond to the same object, lots of parameters to adjust and tune. Bluring images before applying Canny edge detection is quite useful to get rid of unwanted noise in images.

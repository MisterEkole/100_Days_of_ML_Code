## Reinforcement Learning

**Reinforcement Learning** optimizes an agent for sparse, time delayed labels called **rewards** in an environment.  
  
**Markov Decision Processes** or *MDP* for short, are a mathematical framework for modeling decisions using states, actions and rewards.  
  
**Q Learning** is a strategy that finds the optimal action selection **policy** for any *MDP*.

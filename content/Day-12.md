## Visualizing Feature Maps

When a Convolutional Neural Network trains, it is actually adjusting the weights of each node, then each node will become a kernel (or filter) that will be applied to an image, each filter will play a purpose, it can be to detect horizontal o vertical edges, blur out noise, detect patterns, etc.

Here we can see some filters that my CNN created during training applied to an image.

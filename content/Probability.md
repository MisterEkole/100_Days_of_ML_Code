## Probability Basic Concepts
### Independent Events
The probability of an event does not affect the probability of the next event. So for example tossing a coin  does not affect the probability of the next flip.

### Dependent Events
Two events are dependent when the probability of one influences the likelihood of the other event.

### Joint Probability
Is the probability of two or more **indepentent events** happening together. It is calculated by multiplying the probability of each independent event. So the probility of tossing a coin and getting Heads twice in a row is calculated like this  
```P(H) * P(H)  = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25```
